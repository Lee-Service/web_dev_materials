# web_dev_materials
A folder of materials which focus on producing a website using CSS, HTML, PHP and some JavaScript. 
A fully functioning API was created from scratch to facilitate CRUD functionalities with the site being linked to a SQL database. 
This was a huge learning experience for me, so it's solely for disussional purposes. See README for link.

Link to the site in progress is below (CRUD functionality has been mostly removed) - based off pitchfork.com's design.
